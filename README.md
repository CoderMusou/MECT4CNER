Association for Computational Linguistics.

Models and results can be found at our paper in [ACL 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.121/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05418).  

## Introduction
MECT has the lattice and radical streams, which not only possesses FLAT’s word boundary and semantic learning ability but also increases the structure information of Chinese character radicals. With the structural characteristics of Chinese characters, MECT can better capture the semantic information of Chinese characters for Chinese NER.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested under Python 3.7. The required packages are as follows:
```
torch==1.5.1+cu101
numpy==1.18.5
FastNLP==0.5.0
fitlog==0.3.2
```
you can click [here](https://fastnlp.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/) to know more about FastNLP. And you can click [here](https://fitlog.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/) to know more about Fitlog.

## Example to Run the Codes
1. Download the pretrained character embeddings and word embeddings and put them in the data folder.
    * Character embeddings (gigaword_chn.all.a2b.uni.ite50.vec): [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Zlf0OAZKVdydk7loUpkzD2KPEotUE8u/view?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLO6T9D)
    * Bi-gram embeddings (gigaword_chn.all.a2b.bi.ite50.vec): [Baidu Pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLO6T9D)
    * Word(Lattice) embeddings (ctb.50d.vec): [Baidu Pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLO6T9D)
  
2. Get Chinese character structure components(radicals). The radicals used in the paper are from the [online Xinhua dictionary](http://tool.httpcn.com/Zi/). Due to copyright reasons, these data cannot be published. There is a method that can be replaced by [漢語拆字字典](https://github.com/kfcd/chaizi), but inconsistent character decomposition methods cannot guarantee repeatability.

3. Modify the `Utils/paths.py` to add the pretrained embedding and the dataset

4. Run following commands
    * Weibo dataset
    ```shell
    python Utils/paths.py
    python main.py --dataset weibo
    ```
    * Resume dataset
    ```shell
    python Utils/paths.py
    python main.py --dataset resume
    ```
    * Ontonotes dataset
    ```shell
    python Utils/paths.py
    python main.py --dataset ontonotes
    ```
    * MSRA dataset
    ```shell
    python Utils/paths.py --clip_msra
    python main.py --dataset msra
    ```
